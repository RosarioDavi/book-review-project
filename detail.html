                <p>
                    Reading and learning has always been a hinder to me. 
                    I never loved reading or learning as much as i loved playing video games or hanging with friend.
                    Although it was hard for me to begin reading. This book has pushed me to love to learn. 
                    It has even opened my mind to begin to love to read.
